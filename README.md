blang is a programming language that is very minimal and does not need a lot of resources. It's built on top of Python and can soon be used in your IDE.

It's very recent; first version being released on 3/5/2021.

You can try it out by making a blang script called `hworld.blang` and put this in the file:
```blang
say Hello, World!
```
and then running the Python script with `hworld.blang` as the argument.

At this time, modules are not supported in blang, as of 4/6/2021.
