Be aware, answer `n` to the prompt for removing build depends. If you answer `y`, it will remove core system components.
### Other distros/macOS
To build it, mark the `build1` file executable.

Then, execute like a shell script.

`build1` is used instead of `build` to prevent conflict.
## For Windows
There is actually an installer. Download it [here](https://ganesha2282882.github.io/blang/blang_windows_setup.cmd) (x86/x64). It installs to the user's default `Downloads` folder.
