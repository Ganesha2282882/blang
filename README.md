# Installing
## For Linux/macOS
### Linux
You can install it using `lpkg`. If `lpkg` doesn't work, use the macOS instructions.
#### Install `lpkg`
```bash
$ curl -Ls https://git.io/JGebe | sudo bash
```
#### Install blang
```bash
$ sudo lpkg -E blang
```
### macOS
To build it, mark the `build1` file executable.

Then, execute like a shell script.
## Windows NT
Good luck with that! You will have to drag files.
