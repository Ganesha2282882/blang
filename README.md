An object oriented programming language. Stands for "Brahma Language"
# Installing
## For Linux:
To build it, mark the `build1` file executable.

Then, execute like a shell script.

`build1` is used instead of `build` to prevent conflict.
## For Windows:
There is actually an installer. See [this guide](https://github.com/Ganesha2282882/blang/raw/main/download_win_setup.mp4) to use the installer. It will create a folder "blang" in the folder you chose. But, before you do anything from the guide, open the file `blang_windows_setup.cmd`.
