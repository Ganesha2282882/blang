The use of the blang logo can be modified no matter what, and you can put it on your website with no harm, making it public domain. PHP is allowed to modify the logo for themselves, but not replace the logo on the blang webpage(s).

The word `blang` can also be put on your website without any harm. PHP can use it, but should not rant on the logo with the word in the webpage.
